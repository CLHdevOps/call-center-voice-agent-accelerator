## Key Talking Points to Remember

### Opening (Minute 0-5)
> "Thank you for meeting today. I want to understand your current intake process before showing you what we've built."

**Ask**: "What happens when someone calls your intake line after hours?"

### Demo (Minute 5-15)
> "Let me introduce you to Grace. She's an AI receptionist who sounds so human, most callers don't realize they're not talking to a person. Watch this..."

**Show live demo**, narrate the conversation, point out natural speech patterns.

### Pricing (Minute 15-20)
> "Let's talk investment. Package 2 is $35,800 first year. Before you react, let me show you the ROI."

**Calculate savings**: Phone system + staff time = $11,440/year savings

### Discovery (Minute 20-25)
> "I want to make sure Azure is the right fit for your phone system. Let me ask a few quick questions."

**Fill out discovery document**, take good notes

### Close (Minute 25-30)
> "Based on everything we've discussed, I think this is a great fit. What questions do you have?"

**Ask for commitment**: "On a scale of 1-10, where are you?"

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We need to think about it"
**Response**: "Absolutely. What specific questions can I answer to help you think it through?"

### "The price seems high"
**Response**: "I understand. Let me show you the ROI again. You're actually saving $11,440 per year while getting 24/7 coverage."

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**Response**: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on setup fees. Plus, we can start with just after-hours calls to prove it works."
