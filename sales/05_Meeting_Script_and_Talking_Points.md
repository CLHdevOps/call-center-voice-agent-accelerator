## OPENING (Minute 0-5): Build Rapport & Identify Pain

### Introduction (1 minute)

**Your opening**:
> "Thank you for taking the time to meet today. I'm excited to show you a solution that could transform how Mercy House and Sacred Grove handle intake calls. Before we dive in, I'd love to understand your current situation better."

**Opening questions** (pick 2-3):
1. "Walk me through what happens when someone calls your intake line right now."
2. "What percentage of incoming calls would you estimate go to voicemail, especially after hours?"
3. "How much staff time is currently spent on initial intake calls each week?"
4. "What happens when a caller reaches out at 10 PM on a Saturday?"

### Identify Pain Points (2 minutes)

**Listen for these pain points** (and echo them back):

- ❌ **Missed calls after hours**
  - You say: "So you're potentially losing people who need help simply because they called outside business hours. That must be frustrating."

- ❌ **Staff overwhelmed**
  - You say: "It sounds like your intake coordinators spend a lot of time on routine calls that follow the same pattern each time."

- ❌ **Inconsistent intake**
  - You say: "So depending on who answers, the information collected might vary?"

- ❌ **Manual data entry**
  - You say: "And then someone has to manually enter all that information into your system?"

### Transition to Solution (1 minute)

**Your transition**:
> "What if I told you that we've built an AI receptionist named Grace who can answer every single one of those calls, 24/7, collect consistent intake information, and she sounds so human that most callers won't even know they're talking to AI? Let me show you."

---

## DEMO (Minute 5-15): Show, Don't Tell

### Live Demo (7 minutes)

**IMPORTANT: Have the web client ready to go before the meeting!**

**Demo Script**:

1. **Open web client**
   > "This is our testing interface. I'm going to call Grace right now and you'll hear a live conversation. Listen for how natural she sounds."

2. **Make test call** (use persona of concerned parent)
   - Your side: "Hi, I'm calling about getting help for my son."
   - Let Grace respond
   - Continue: "He's been struggling with alcohol. We're in Denver, Colorado."
   - Let Grace ask follow-up questions
   - Provide: Name, phone number, etc.
   - Ask a question: "How much does the program cost?"
   - Let Grace answer
   - End call naturally

3. **Point out key features** while demo is running:
   - "Notice how she pauses naturally?"
   - "Hear that 'um' before she answered? That's intentional."
   - "See how she remembered I said 'my son' earlier?"
   - "She's collecting information without making it feel like a form."

4. **Show conversation log immediately after**
   > "And here's what happens in the background. The entire conversation is logged with timestamps. Your intake coordinator would see this transcript and all the information Grace collected."

### Alternative: Play Pre-Recorded Demo (if live demo isn't possible)

**Have a backup video/audio recording of a good conversation ready!**

**Play it and narrate**:
> "This is a recording of an actual test call. Listen to how the conversation flows..."

[Play recording]

> "Notice she sounds human, not robotic. This caller had no idea they were talking to AI until we told them afterward."

### Address Immediate Reactions (2 minutes)

**Watch for these reactions**:

**Skepticism**: "That sounds too good to be true..."
- Response: "I know it seems that way. The technology has advanced incredibly in the last year. Azure's Voice Live API is what makes this possible. Want to try calling her yourself?" [Offer to let them test]

**Excitement**: "Wow, this is amazing!"
- Response: "Right? And this is just scratching the surface. Let me show you what this could look like fully deployed in your organization."

**Concern**: "What if she messes up?"
- Response: "Great question. Grace is designed to handle her specific role: initial intake. Anything complex or beyond her scope, she politely explains that an intake coordinator will call back to help with that. She knows her boundaries."

### Show Value Beyond Demo (1 minute)

**Quick value points**:
> "So imagine this: It's 2 AM. Someone's family is in crisis. They find your number online and call. Today, that goes to voicemail. With Grace, she answers immediately, has a compassionate conversation, collects their information, and assures them a coordinator will call first thing in the morning. You've just turned a missed opportunity into a captured lead."

## PRICING & ROI (Minute 15-20): Make It a No-Brainer

### Present Pricing (2 minutes)

**Pull out pricing sheet**:

> "Let's talk investment. We have three packages, but I think Package 2 makes the most sense for you."

**Explain Package 2 (AI + Phone System)**:
- Setup: $19,000 (save $2,000 vs separate)
- Monthly: $1,400/month
- First year total: $35,800

**Immediately follow with**:
> "Now, before you react to that number, let me show you the ROI."

### ROI Breakdown (2 minutes)

**Calculate on paper in front of them**:

**Phone System Savings**:
> "What are you paying per month for your current phone system?"

[Listen to their answer]

> "Most organizations with 17 lines pay around $850-1,000/month for traditional phone service. Our Azure solution is $480/month. That's $520/month savings, or $6,240 per year. So the phone system literally pays for itself in less than 2 years."

**Staff Time Savings**:
> "How many intake calls do you handle per week? Let's say 40 calls, 10 minutes each. That's 6-7 hours of staff time per week. At $25/hour, that's about $8,700 per year in staff time."

> "Grace handles the initial intake for about 60% of those calls completely, freeing up 4 hours per week. That's $5,200 in staff time saved annually."

**Total ROI**:
> "So combined, you're saving $11,440 per year while getting 24/7 coverage and never missing another call. And that doesn't even account for the value of the additional people you'll help because you're now available after hours."

### Payment Flexibility (1 minute)

**Offer options**:
> "We have flexible payment terms. You can spread the setup cost over 12 months if that makes budgeting easier, or pay annually up front for a 10% discount."

---

## DISCOVERY (Minute 20-25): Qualify for ACS Migration

### Phone System Assessment (3 minutes)

**Pull out discovery questions document**:

> "I want to make sure the Azure phone system will be a perfect fit for your setup. Let me ask you a few quick questions."

**Critical questions** (ask these first):

1. **Internet**: "What's your internet speed? Upload and download?"
   - ✅ Need: 10+ Mbps upload per location minimum
   - ❌ Red flag: Slow or unreliable internet

2. **Current system**: "Who's your current phone provider and what type of system?"
   - Looking for: Contract status, monthly cost, satisfaction

3. **Phone numbers**: "Do you need to keep your existing numbers or are new numbers OK?"
   - ✅ Easy: Port existing numbers
   - ⚠️ Note: Porting takes 2-3 weeks

4. **Critical features**: "What features do you absolutely need?"
   - Listen for: Voicemail, forwarding, auto-attendant (all standard)
   - ❌ Red flag: Heavy faxing, paging systems (need workarounds)

**Take notes and**:
> "Based on what you've told me, I think you're a great candidate for Azure Communication Services. I don't see any blockers. Let me follow up with a detailed technical assessment."

### EHR System Discovery (1 minute)

**If interested in Phase 3**:

> "One more thing: What EHR system do you use?"

[Listen to answer]

> "Great. [Epic/Cerner/Other] has a solid API. We can definitely integrate with that. I'll include EHR integration pricing in the follow-up proposal."

---

## CLOSE (Minute 25-30): Get Commitment

### Decision-Making Process (2 minutes)

**Ask directly**:
> "What's your decision-making process look like? Who else needs to be involved?"

[Listen to answer]

**Identify the decision maker**:
- Just them? Great!
- Board approval? When's next meeting?
- Budget approval? What's timeline?

**Ask about timeline**:
> "When would you ideally want this deployed?"

[Listen for urgency signals]

### Trial Close (1 minute)

**Test the waters**:
> "On a scale of 1 to 10, where are you in terms of moving forward with this?"

**If 7+**: Great! Let's talk next steps.
**If 4-6**: "What would it take to get you to an 8 or 9?"
**If 1-3**: "What are your main concerns?" [Address objections]

### Handle Objections (1-2 minutes as needed)

**Common objections and responses**:

**"We need to think about it"**
- Response: "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific questions can I answer to help you think it through?"

**"The budget isn't available right now"**
- Response: "I understand. Would the monthly payment plan option work better? That spreads the setup cost over 12 months, making it much more manageable."

**"We're not sure about AI answering our calls"**
- Response: "That's fair. What if we start with just after-hours calls? Grace handles calls when you're closed, and your staff handles daytime calls. Once you see how well she performs, we can expand."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
- Response: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If the system doesn't meet the agreed specifications, you get your setup fee back. We're confident enough to put our money where our mouth is."

### Next Steps (1 minute)

**If they're ready**:
> "Fantastic! Here's what happens next:
> 1. I'll send you the formal proposal by [tomorrow/Friday]
> 2. You review with your team
> 3. We schedule a kickoff call next week
> 4. We're live in 5-6 weeks
>
> Sound good?"

**If they need time**:
> "No problem. Let me send you:
> 1. This proposal with all the details we discussed
> 2. A recording of our demo today
> 3. Reference contacts from similar organizations
>
> When would be a good time for me to follow up? [Schedule specific date/time]"

### Final Close (30 seconds)

**End strong**:
> "I'm really excited about what Grace can do for Mercy House and Sacred Grove. Think about all the people who call after hours looking for help – right now, they're getting voicemail. With Grace, they get a compassionate, immediate response. That's going to change lives."

**Handshake and**:
> "Thanks for your time today. I'll get that proposal over to you [timeframe], and I'm available anytime if questions come up."

## CHEAT SHEET: Quick Answers to Common Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: What if our internet goes down?**
A: "Calls can be forwarded to a backup number like a cell phone. We also recommend backup internet for mission-critical deployments, but most customers have enough redundancy built in."

**Q: Can Grace transfer calls to a human?**
A: "Currently, Grace completes the intake and an intake coordinator calls back. If you need live transfers, we can add that feature – it's a common request."

**Q: What languages does Grace speak?**
A: "English fluently. Spanish is available and improving. We can train her in other languages if needed."

**Q: Can we change what Grace says?**
A: "Yes, easily. The prompts are editable without any coding. You can adjust her responses anytime."

**Q: How long does it take to deploy?**
A: "5-6 weeks from contract signing to go-live. 2 weeks for development, 1 week for testing, 1 week for training."

### Business Questions

**Q: What if we want to cancel?**
A: "After the first year, it's month-to-month with 30-day notice. You keep all your data and can port your phone numbers anywhere."

**Q: Do you have references?**
A: "Yes, I can connect you with [similar organizations] who are using the system. They've seen [specific results]."

**Q: What about HIPAA compliance?**
A: "The Azure infrastructure is HIPAA-compliant. We can execute a BAA (Business Associate Agreement) as part of the contract."

**Q: What happens if Grace gets a call she can't handle?**
A: "She gracefully explains that an intake coordinator will call back to help with that specific question. She knows her limits and doesn't make things up."

**Q: Can we customize Grace for different programs?**
A: "Absolutely. We can create different versions of Grace for different intake lines or customize based on the program."

## OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK

**Use the "Feel, Felt, Found" method**:

**Example**:
> "I understand how you **feel**. Other clients have **felt** the same way when they first saw this. What they **found** was [evidence/result that addresses concern]."

**Specific examples**:

**Objection: "We've tried AI before and it was terrible"**
- "I understand how you feel. Many of our clients felt the same way after bad experiences with older chatbots. What they found was that Voice Live API is a completely different generation of technology. Those earlier systems were rule-based. This is actually conversational AI. Would you like to hear the difference?" [Play demo]

**Objection: "Our callers need to talk to a real person"**
- "I understand how you feel. That's a common concern, and your callers' experience is obviously critical. What our clients have found is that Grace provides such a natural conversation that callers feel heard and helped, often not realizing it's AI. And remember, this doesn't replace your intake coordinators – it extends their reach to be available 24/7. The coordinator still makes the personal follow-up call."

---

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

**Signs they're not a good fit** (and how to handle):

❌ **No budget, no timeline, no decision-making authority**
- Action: Politely disengage. Offer to connect with decision maker instead.

❌ **Unreliable internet or no willingness to upgrade**
- Action: Explain that phone system depends on internet. Offer AI receptionist only (doesn't require ACS migration).

❌ **Want unlimited customization and perfect AI**
- Action: Set realistic expectations. Grace is very good but not perfect. She handles 80-90% of calls well.

❌ **Looking for free proof of concept**
- Action: Offer demo (which you're providing). Explain that custom POC requires setup investment.

## WINNING STRATEGIES

**🎯 Lead with empathy**
- Acknowledge their pain points
- Show you understand their mission (helping people with addiction)
- Frame the solution as helping them help more people

**🎯 Demo is everything**
- People need to hear Grace to believe it
- Live demo > recorded demo > no demo
- Let them test call Grace themselves if possible

**🎯 Make the numbers simple**
- ROI should be obvious
- Show cost savings clearly
- Focus on value, not features

**🎯 Create urgency (ethically)**
- "Every day without this, you're missing after-hours calls"
- "Holiday season is coming – imagine having 24/7 coverage"
- "We have availability to start in [soon timeframe], but that fills up"

**🎯 Offer easy yes**
- Start with Phase 1 only if they're hesitant
- Monthly payment plan reduces barrier
- 30-day guarantee eliminates risk

## YOUR CONFIDENCE BUILDERS

**Why you should be confident selling this**:

✅ **The technology works** – it's not vaporware
✅ **The pricing is fair** – competitive and includes real value
✅ **You have references** – other organizations using it successfully
✅ **The ROI is real** – measurable cost savings and time savings
✅ **You're solving real pain** – missed calls = missed opportunities to help people
✅ **You have a backup plan** – if they're nervous, start small (after-hours only)

## FINAL TIPS

1. **Arrive early** – test the demo, make sure internet works
2. **Bring business cards** – leave physical materials
3. **Take notes** – shows you're listening and helps with follow-up
4. **Don't oversell** – let the demo speak for itself
5. **Ask for the business** – actually ask for commitment at end
6. **Follow up quickly** – strike while iron is hot
7. **Be yourself** – authenticity builds trust

---

## IF THINGS GO WRONG

**Demo doesn't work**:
- Plan B: Play pre-recorded video
- Plan C: Walk through screenshots
- Stay calm, apologize briefly, move on

**They're not engaged**:
- Ask questions to re-engage
- "What would be most valuable for you to see?"
- Cut demo short, focus on their needs

**Pricing sticker shock**:
- Slow down, go through ROI again
- Offer payment plan
- Focus on monthly cost, not total
- Compare to current spending

**They're already working with a competitor**:
- Ask what they like/don't like about current solution
- Position yours as better (more human, better price, etc.)
- Don't badmouth competitor, just show your strengths

---

**Remember**: You're not just selling software. You're offering a way for Mercy House to help more people find recovery. That's a mission worth believing in.

**Good luck!** 🎯
